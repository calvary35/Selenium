Handling Alerts in Selenium

What is an alert?
Alert is the popup message that you get on your application.
Alert takes the focus of our main screen/page.
We can not proceed until we have handled this alert

Types of alerts:
1.WebBased Alerts/html Alerts: We can simply inspect them and deal with them in a regular way
2. JavaScript Alerts: We can handle these alerts by using Alert interface in selenium
3.WindowBased Alert: We can not handle them in Selenium

Authentication Alert:

Information username and password inside the url:

Username: admin
Password: password

//URL:https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth//username:password@
admin:admin
password:admin

*****************************Frames********************************
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch manually to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch manually to a frame and switch manually back to the main page


***************review*****************

1.WebBase or Html alerts --> inspect them and like deal with them in a regular manner
2.Java Script alert -->can u inspect ? No!!!
  how do u deal with them?
   alert interface to deal with them.

   Appraoch to use alert interface ?

      once the alert appears

      Alert X=driver.switchTo.alert();
      x.Accept();
      x.Dismiss();
      X.sendleys();
      x.getText();

3.Window based Alert-- > No we can not handle them using selenium



1. when ever we want to deal with an element inside a frame , can we appraoch it directly by standing on the main page?
NO we can not

2.appraoch to dela with an element isnide a frame
  1.driver.SwitchTo.frame();
  2.Then deal with that element;


 XXX) Techniques to switch to a frame :
 1.By Index;   --> indexing starts from 0
 2. by Name or Id-->  the name and id in the tag  "as an attribute"   <iframe  name ="frame1"  ,id="abc">
 3.By Webelement -->
     the arppraoch to swithc using webElement
        1. to find the xpath if the frame
        2. driver findElement (xpath)
        3 driver.switchTO.frame(Webelement)
