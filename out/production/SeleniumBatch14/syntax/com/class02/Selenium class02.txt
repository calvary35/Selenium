                Selenium Class02

All the web application
are developed using HTML.

HTML------>

tags:

<html>
    <body>
        <button> hello </button>
    </body>
</html>


------------------------------------------

WebElement:
    Anything you see on website is called a WebElement

    Some common WebElements:

    1.Text Buttons
    2.Radio Buttons
    3.CheckBoxes
    4.Calendars
    5.Drop Downs
    6.Tables

Attributes:

    <button> My button </button>
    text is written between the opening and closing tags.

    <button class="abc" ,id="Butn"> my button </button>

    whatever we have inside the tag is called attribute

    what is the value of the attribute class ---> answer: "abc"
    what is the value of the attribute id--> answer: "Butn"

-------------------------------------------------------

Locators:
    Locators help us find a particular webElement on the page

    -ID
    -Name
    -Tagname
    -xpath
    -linktext
    -partialLinkText
    -CSS Selector
    -ClassName

The purpose of having multiple locators is because
some tags might not have an ID (you can use another locator)

Two webElements can have a common locator (e.g. <input id ="box", name="textbox"/> ,
                                                <input id ="box", class = "btn" > ) *this is why we have multiple
                                                                                        locators

-------------------------------------anchor tag----------------------
<a> --> anchor tag
usually the links are placed in this tag
    if there is a text in the <a> tag then you can use linktext locator

NOSUCH ELEMENT EXCEPTION:
    Occurs when the Driver is unable to find the element on the page
    1.the locator is wrong
    2. the element is not on that page.

Duplicate values of attributes
    <input id="box" ,name="textbox"/> -->Username Box
    <input id="box" ,class= "password"/> -->Password Box
    Example:
    driver.findElement(By.id("box")).sendKeys("hello");

    Driver is going to go in the DOM from top to bottom, the first tage with ID box will be picked and keys
    will be sent to that.


Recap of today's class

1.Locators --> id, name, class, partialLinkText, LinkText

2.Linktext --> only when we have a link tag <a> and it has some text

3.Partial and Link Text --> using partial you can enter just a part of the text

4.if there is numbers in the value of the locators..should we use it? (avoid it)
5.No SUCH ELEMENT error --> 1.the locator is wrong, 2. the element is not on the page
6.Send the text and perform click operation
