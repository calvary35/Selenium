Radio Buttons:

    How to deal with radio buttons:

    1.Find the element
    2.Click on it

    If you want to del with multiple radio buttons:

    1.Find all the elements
    2.Loop through it
    3.Check for your desired one
    4.Click on it

    Multi Select Drop Down vs. Single Select

    Is there any difference in how we deal with multi select drop and a single select drop down

    Are there other options available to be used with multi select drop down?

    In multi select we have the option
    to deselectALL();
        deselectByVisibleText();
        deselectByIndex();


    1.text Box --> sendKeys(),clear() *driver.findElement() *SendKeys(),clear()
    2.Buttons --> click(), if it has text (get text() can be also used)--> *driver.Findelement() ,*click(), getText()
    3.Radio Buttons--> click() --> *driver.FindElement *click()
        in case of multiple radio buttons the approach is
        1.findElements()-->the Xpath you write for finding these elements should be able to select all the desired elements
        2.You traverse through the list
        3.You can use getText(), getAttribute() to extract information about that particular radio button
        4.if it is the desired one we click

        the whole above approach is used for checkBoxes

        .isDisplayed()--> the element is displayed(visible) on the page
        .isEnabled()--> the element can be selected or not
        .isSelected()--> the element is selected or not

    4.DropDowns:
        2 types --> single select, multiselect

        The approach for dealing with both is exactly same
        Approach:
        1.find the element --> the select tag
        2.Select sel = new Select (WebElement that we found for select tag in step 1)

        Using 3 method you can select the options from the drop downs
        ByIndex(),ByValue(),ByVisibleText().

    The other options available to us in Multiple Select are:
    deselectALL();
    deselectByVisibleText();
    deselectByIndex();

    --In order to check if the dropDown is multi select or not --> .isMultiple();

    --In order to have all the options available to us on the DropDown using select class --> .getOptions

    Note: We can only use select class if---> The drop down is made using select tage;
